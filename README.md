# page-replacement-simulation
- This is a college mini project in simulating [page replacement algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_replacement_algorithm)
# The Implemented argorithms are :
- [FIFO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_replacement_algorithm#First-in,_first-out)
- [LRU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_replacement_algorithm#Least_recently_used)
- LFU
- [Second-Chance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_replacement_algorithm#Second-chance)
- Enhanced Second-Chance
- optimal

# The Implementation
- First, we generate a random page-reference string where page numbers range from 0 to 99.
- Then, we apply the random page-reference string to each algorithm and record the number of page faults incurred by each algorithm.

# For more information
- if you want to further understand the algorithms and their implementations read the attatched document
